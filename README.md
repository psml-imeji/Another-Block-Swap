# Another-Block-Swap
This is a remake of the Block Swap by CorgiTaco.
Supports Minecraft 1.21.4
The original version by CorgiTaco can be found here: https://github.com/CorgiTaco-MC/Block-Swap
This is not a ready-to-use mod and it is a MCreator project that require MCreator installed to use. (I am new to MCreator and did not found a way to add a config file, so I leave the project for now, sorry.)

# How to use
1. Unzip the file and open "another_block_swap.mcreator". The project file can be downloaded at "https://github.com/psml-imeji/Another-Block-Swap/releases/tag/Release".
2. Open the "Swapper" in the Mod Elements tab.
3. Add the blocks you want to swap. It have two default swaps: Dirt to Diamond Ore and Cobweb to Air.
4. Click "Workspace -> Export the mod for distribution"
5. Move the exported file to your Minecraft mod folder

# What does this mod do
This mod simply replace a block with another, in those cases:
1. On world gen, it swaps every block in a chunk. This will only do once per chunk to prevent lag.
2. It swaps every blocks near the player, in a 8 blocks radius.
