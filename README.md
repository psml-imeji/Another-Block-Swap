# Another-Block-Swap
This is a remake of the Block Swap by CorgiTaco.<br>
Supports NeoForge 1.21.1 and 1.21.4<br>
The original version by CorgiTaco can be found here: https://github.com/CorgiTaco-MC/Block-Swap<br>
This is not a ready-to-use mod and it is a MCreator project that require MCreator installed to use. (I am new to MCreator and did not found a way to add a config file, so I leave the project for now, sorry.)

# How to use
1. Unzip the file and open "another_block_swap.mcreator". The project file can be downloaded at "https://github.com/psml-imeji/Another-Block-Swap/releases/tag/Release".
2. Open the "Swapper" in the Mod Elements tab.
3. Add the blocks you want to swap. It have two default swaps: Dirt to Diamond Ore and Cobweb to Air. You can remove those two and add the swaps you want.
4. If you are about to use it on 1.21.1, click "Workspace -> Workspace Setting" on top and change the version to 1.21.1. It takes a while to convert the project. If you are about to use it on 1.21.4, simply skip this step.
5. Click "Workspace -> Export the mod for distribution" on top.
6. Move the exported file to your Minecraft mod folder

# What does this mod do
This mod simply replace a block with another, in those cases:
1. It swaps every single block in the chunks near by the player. This will only do once per chunk to prevent lag.
2. It swaps every blocks near the player, in a 8 blocks radius.
